# (FA)cial (LA)dmarks (TRA)cking for speech language pathology

This is a facial landmark tracking algorithm developed as
part of my Final Years Engineering Honours Project.

The algorithm that I am developing will aim to help speech
language pathologist make more informed diagnostic assessment 
for children with speech disorders.
